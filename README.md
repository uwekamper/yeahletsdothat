Yeah Let's Do That
==================

"Yeah Let's Do That" is a Bitcoin-based crowd-funding tool (early Alpha stage)

**DO NOT USE THIS!** This is early alpha stage. Really, I mean it. You could loose all your money!


If you want to try it, use the Bitcoin testnet only.

bitcoin.conf
------------

Your bitcoind/bitcoin-qt configuration file should look like this.

    testnet=1
    server=1
    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=*yourpassword*
