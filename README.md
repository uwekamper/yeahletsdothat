Yeah Let's Do That
==================

"Yeah Let's Do That" (YLDT) is a self-hosted crowd-funding tool.

**DO NOT USE THIS!** This is early alpha stage. Really, I mean it.
You could loose all your money!

Payment Plugins
---------------

YLDT supports a number of different payment methods.

Currently supported methods:
* Braintree payments (credit cards, Paypal, Bitcoin)
* Cash payments (for face-to-face meetings with manual processing)

Planned:
* Bitcoin
* DogeCoin

Configuration of the Bitcoin daemon (bitcoin.conf)
--------------------------------------------------

The Bitcoin payment plugin is defunct at the moment. This is just for reference.

Your bitcoind/bitcoin-qt configuration file should look like this.

    testnet=1
    server=1
    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=*yourpassword*

How Payments Are Processed
--------------------------

The following state graph shows the states which a transaction can go through.

When a new transaction is created, it is immediately in the "pledged" state.
In every step the transaction can go into the "aborted" state â€“ either trough
user interaction or a failing payment.
