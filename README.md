Yeah Let's Do That
==================

"Yeah Let's Do That" is a self-hosted crowd-funding tool (early alpha stage)

**DO NOT USE THIS!** This is early alpha stage. Really, I mean it. You could loose all your money!


Configuration of the Bitcoin daemon (bitcoin.conf)
--------------------------------------------------

The Bitcoin payment plugin is defunct at the moment. This is just for reference.

Your bitcoind/bitcoin-qt configuration file should look like this.

    testnet=1
    server=1
    rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
    rpcpassword=*yourpassword*
